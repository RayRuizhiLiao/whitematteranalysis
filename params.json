Install python. \r\nAnaconda is a nice option since it has VTK.\r\n###2. Install the following python packages (dependencies).\r\n\r\n* joblib (This can be done with easy_install, for example.)\r\n* scipy\r\n(scipy is included in anaconda or EPD or other python distributions, possibly)\r\n* vtk (vtk is included in anaconda or other python distributions, possibly)\r\n\r\n####If your python does not already have VTK, compile it.\r\n* VTK: http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Building\r\n* http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Git/Download\r\n\r\nYou will need to compile it with python wrapping. VTK_WRAP_PYTHON must be on.\r\nMake sure it finds the version of python that you want to use for this project, at configure time. You may need to toggle t for advanced mode in ccmake. I have something like this when I run:\r\n     cd VTK-build\r\n     ccmake ../VTK\r\n\r\n       PYTHON_EXECUTABLE                /Users/lauren/anaconda/bin/python            \r\n       PYTHON_EXTRA_LIBS                                                             \r\n       PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR               /Users/lauren/anaconda/pkgs/python-2.7.4-1/in\r\n       PYTHON_LIBRARY                   /Users/lauren/anaconda/lib/libpython2.7.dylib\r\n       PYTHON_UTIL_LIBRARY              /usr/lib/libutil.dylib   \r\n\r\nNote this requires git and cmake. More information is at vtk.org.\r\nThen install it into your python:\r\n     cd VTK-build/Wrapping/Python\r\n     python setup.py install\r\n\r\n###3. Install WhiteMatterAnalysis into your python.\r\n\r\n     cd WhiteMatterAnalysis\r\n     python setup.py install\r\n\r\n###4. Test the installation.\r\nRun python, then:\r\n\r\n    >>> import whitematteranalysis as wma\r\n\r\nThis will produce errors if the required packages are not found.\r\n\r\n###5.
